# Drowsiness_Detection_System_Using_OpenCV
# Computer_Vision_Project

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, Dlib, and Scipy, with an audible alert using Pygame. It monitors eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect signs of drowsiness and triggers an alarm if the driver appears sleepy for a sustained period.
