# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_System_Using_OpenCV
# Computer_Vision_Project

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, Dlib, and Scipy. It monitors eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect signs of drowsiness and triggers an alarm if the driver appears sleepy for a sustained period.

🧠 HOW IT WORKS :

The system uses facial landmark detection to locate the eyes and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). When the eyes remain closed for a number of consecutive frames, an alarm is triggered.

1. EAR is computed for both eyes using Euclidean distances between facial landmarks.
2. If EAR drops below a threshold (0.25) for a set number of frames (30), an alert is sounded.
3. The system continuously streams from a webcam and displays the video feed with eye contours and warnings.


⚙️ TECHNOLOGIES USED  : 

1. OpenCV – for video streaming and image processing.
2. Dlib – for facial landmark detection using a pre-trained 68-point predictor.
3. Scipy – to calculate Euclidean distance.
4. Pygame (mixer) – to play an audio alert.
5. Imutils – for easy OpenCV operations and facial utilities.


🚀 FEATURES :

1. 🔍 Real-time face and eye tracking using a webcam
2. 📏 Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) based drowsiness detection
3. 📢 Audio alert when eyes remain closed beyond a safe threshold
4. 🧠 68-point facial landmark detection via dlib
5. 🖼️ Visual feedback (drawn contours on eyes)
